# 🧑‍💼 Employees Task Using .NET Core and Angular

This is a simple full-stack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with:

- **.NET Core Web API** (Backend)
- **Angular** (Frontend)

The application allows users to manage a list of employees, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting employee records. It also includes bonus features like search and pagination.

✅ The project is fully integrated — you only need to run the backend first, then run the frontend, and everything will work automatically.  
The frontend is already configured to communicate with the backend using `localhost`, so no extra setup is required.
